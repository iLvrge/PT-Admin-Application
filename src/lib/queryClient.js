/**
 * Defaults chosen for this app:
 *  - staleTime 30s: screens re-mount as panes open and close, and refetching
 *    identical data on every mount is what makes navigation feel slow.
 *  - networkMode 'offlineFirst': a query is paused rather than failed while
 *    offline, so it resumes on reconnect instead of surfacing an error the
 *    user cannot act on.
 *  - no retry on 4xx: a 401/403/404 will not fix itself.
 *
 * Pinned to @tanstack/react-query v4: v5 requires React 18, since it is built
 * on useSyncExternalStore, and this app is on React 16. Moving to v5 is part of
 * the React 18 upgrade, not separable from it.
